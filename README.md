## 🌟 Problem Statement

### Theme: Financial Technology

**Limited Access to Financial Services**
- Significant population lacks formal banking systems
- Reliance on informal lenders leads to exploitation through high-interest rates

**Lack of Financial Literacy**
- Language, education, and technology barriers prevent financial awareness
- Limited knowledge of savings, insurance, and investment options

**No Emergency Financial Cushion**
- Absence of safety net leaves families vulnerable during crises
- Economic shocks from crop failures, medical emergencies, or natural disasters

**Barriers to Credit Access**
- Lack of credit history excludes people from formal lending opportunities
- Limited financial opportunities for economic growth

### Technical Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Frontend | Next.js 14 + TypeScript | User interface and experience |
| Backend | Node.js | Primary server application |
| ML Services | FastAPI, TensorFlow, PyTorch | Machine learning models |
| Blockchain | Polygon (MATIC), Solidity | Smart contracts and transactions |
| Database | MongoDB Atlas | Data storage and management |
| AI Integration | Agentic AI, Langchain | Conversational AI and automation |

## 🛠️ Key Components

### 1. Machine Learning Pipeline

```python
# Credit Scoring Model
class CreditScoringEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.xgboost_model = XGBoostClassifier()
        self.resnet_model = ResNet50()
        self.yolo_model = YOLOv8()
    
    def assess_creditworthiness(self, user_data):
        # ML-based risk assessment
        risk_score = self.calculate_risk(user_data)
        return self.make_decision(risk_score)
```

### 2. Blockchain Smart Contracts

```solidity
// Smart Contract for Community Banking
contract CommunityBank {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
    mapping(address => uint256) public creditScores;
    
    function depositFunds() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        emit FundsDeposited(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }
    
    function requestLoan(uint256 amount) public returns (bool) {
        require(creditScores[msg.sender] >= 600, "Credit score too low");
        return processLoan(msg.sender, amount);
    }
}
```

### 3. Voice Interface Implementation

```javascript
// Voice Recognition System
const voiceInterface = {
    initSpeechRecognition: () => {
        const recognition = new webkitSpeechRecognition();
        recognition.lang = 'hi-IN'; // Supports multiple languages
        recognition.onresult = handleVoiceCommand;
        return recognition;
    },
    
    processFinancialQuery: async (query) => {
        const response = await AIService.generateResponse(query);
        return speechSynthesizer.speak(response);
    }
};
```
